# 📓 THE 365-DAY DEV JOURNEY: Jose Aparicio  EN-VERSION
> **"Logic is my superpower, syntax is just the tool."**

## 🚀 MY CAREER UPGRADE: FROM HOSPITALITY TO WEB DEVELOPER

This diary is more than just a list of topics studied; it is the **engineering log** of my professional transition. After 8+ years managing teams and resolving crises in the **Hospitality sector (UK & Spain)**, I am applying that same resilience and problem-solving capacity to the world of software development.

### 🛠️ WHAT WILL YOU FIND IN THIS LOGBOOK?
For a recruiter, the question is always: *Can he actually solve problems?*. Here, I document my daily struggles, logic errors, and technical victories to prove three things:

* **Unwavering Consistency:** A daily record of my evolution, unfiltered.
* **Debugging Mindset:** I don't just show the code that works; I show how I **"tore the building down"** to build solid foundations when things got tough.
* **Seniority in Attitude:** My previous experience is not a gap; it’s the **engine** that accelerates my learning pace and my user-centered product vision.

## 🗓️ [Day 20: February 20th, 2026]

### 📝 Daily Summary
Today I reached my first **major mental "click."** My focus wasn't just on writing lines of code, but on mastering the art of **debugging** and understanding the deep control flow in JavaScript and the selector hierarchy in CSS.

### 🛠️ Technical Concepts Mastered:

* **💻 JavaScript: Logic & Structure**
    * **Variable Management:** Refined the use of **let** and dynamic reassignment.
    * **Template Literals:** Implemented **backticks** (`` ` ``) to inject variables into strings cleanly.
    * **Modulo Operator (%):** Key to solving pricing logic based on even/odd products.
    * **Block Scope:** Understood why variables declared with **let** live and die within the curly braces `{}`.

* **🎨 CSS: Layout & Selectors**
    * **Box Model:** Deep dive into **padding**, **border**, and **margin** to prevent container overflow.
    * **Interaction (UX):** Used **:hover** pseudo-classes for visual feedback.
    * **Relationship Selectors:** **+** (Adjacent sibling) and **~** (General sibling).

### 🧩 Problem Solving (Debug Log)
* **Milestone:** Built my first digital newspaper from scratch.
* **Fixes:** Corrected syntax errors in **text-transform** and learned to distinguish **font-weight** from **font-family**.
* **Status:** My **Flexbox** structure is finally starting to make sense.

## 🗓️ [Day 22: February 22nd, 2026]

### 🔨 Forging the Odin Project Sign-up Form
Today I finished the registration form project and, honestly, **the level-up is clear.** I didn't just write code; I made design decisions and used professional tools.

### 🧠 What I learned today:
* **📐 Grid & Real Alignment:** Mastered how to split the screen into columns (**2fr 3fr**) and used **grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr** inside the form so that all inputs stayed perfectly aligned in pairs.
* **🖋️ Typographic Hierarchy:** Reserved the **Norse** font for branding and call-to-action buttons, while using **Inter** for long texts and labels.
* **🌑 Intentional Shadows:** Created a directional **Bottom Shadow** using the Y-axis (**box-shadow: 0 8px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)**). Now the form looks like it’s floating.
* **✨ Micro-interactions:** Configured a professional **:hover** effect that lifts the button using **transform: translateY(-3px)**. It feels **"alive."**

## 🗓️ [Day 23: February 23rd, 2026]

### 🚀 "Today I stopped making a web that 'works' and started making a professional one"
Today was a day of **brutal intensity.** I jumped from visual design to pure logic.

### 📱 The Battle for Adaptability (Responsive Design)
* **The Strategy Shift:** Refactored the main container. From desktop **Grid** to mobile **Flexbox** with **flex-direction: column**.
* **Overcoming CSS Chaos:** Fought against the **CSS Cascade.** Learned to prioritize and organize my selectors so the layout wouldn't **"break"** when shrinking the window.

### 🎨 Refining the Experience (Advanced UI & UX)
* **🔍 Intelligent Validation:** Implemented the **:user-invalid** pseudo-class. Fixed the error where red borders appeared as soon as the page loaded. Now, feedback only appears after interaction. A **"pro"** touch.
* **⚡ Micro-interactions:** Added **transition** and **transform** effects to **input:focus**. The fields **"react"** when you’re about to type.
* **✍️ Elite Typography:** Configured **'Norse'** and **'Inter'** fonts by adjusting **letter-spacing**.

### 🥊 JavaScript and the Booking Logic (The Big Challenge)
> **"From Frustration to Success: How I built the Campus & Crema Engine"**

1. **The "Clean Slate" Moment:** Started the day with code that was a jungle. I made the hard but smart decision: **starting from scratch.** Tearing down the building to build solid foundations.
2. **The Syntax Labyrinth:**
    * **The Symbol War:** Struggled with **=** vs **===**. Discovered that using **(isOccupied === true)** inside a loop is like asking a question to the air. The solution was a direct command: **isOccupied = true;**.
    * **The Chaos of Parentheses and Braces:** Brackets that opened but never closed.
    * **The Treacherous Semicolon:** Found a semicolon right after a **for** loop that was blocking the entire engine.


## 🗓️ [Day 24: February 24th, 2026]

### 🏋️ "Training Session: Algorithms and Data Structures"

### 🚀 Daily Achievements
* **💼 Use Case Resolution:** Practical exercises simulating real environments (**E-commerce**, **Login Systems**, and **User Profiles**).
* **⚙️ Dynamic Logic Construction:** Learned to generate dynamic HTML structures using functions and **Template Literals.**
* **📂 Information Architecture:** Practiced data nesting, integrating **Arrays within Objects**.

### 🥊 The "Fight" with the Code (Error-based Learning)
* **⚔️ The Symbol War:** Consolidated that **{}** are for objects and **[]** are for lists.
* **↪️ The "Return" Challenge:** Identified why functions died when confusing **return** with **console.log.**
* **🧪 Mutation vs Assignment:** Learned the hard way how using **=** instead of **.push()** can destroy a string-based database.
