> **"Logic is my superpower, syntax is just the tool."**

## 🚀 MY CAREER UPGRADE: FROM HOSPITALITY TO WEB DEVELOPER

This diary is more than just a list of topics studied; it is the **engineering log** of my professional transition. After 8+ years managing teams and resolving crises in the **Hospitality sector (UK & Spain)**, I am applying that same resilience and problem-solving capacity to the world of software development.

### 🛠️ WHAT WILL YOU FIND IN THIS LOGBOOK?
For a recruiter, the question is always: *Can he actually solve problems?*. Here, I document my daily struggles, logic errors, and technical victories to prove three things:

* **Unwavering Consistency:** A daily record of my evolution, unfiltered.
* **Debugging Mindset:** I don't just show the code that works; I show how I **"tore the building down"** to build solid foundations when things got tough.
* **Seniority in Attitude:** My previous experience is not a gap; it’s the **engine** that accelerates my learning pace and my user-centered product vision.

## 🗓️ [Day 20: February 20th, 2026]

### 📝 Daily Summary
Today I reached my first **major mental "click."** My focus wasn't just on writing lines of code, but on mastering the art of **debugging** and understanding the deep control flow in JavaScript and the selector hierarchy in CSS.

### 🛠️ Technical Concepts Mastered:

* **💻 JavaScript: Logic & Structure**
    * **Variable Management:** Refined the use of **let** and dynamic reassignment.
    * **Template Literals:** Implemented **backticks** (`` ` ``) to inject variables into strings cleanly.
    * **Modulo Operator (%):** Key to solving pricing logic based on even/odd products.
    * **Block Scope:** Understood why variables declared with **let** live and die within the curly braces `{}`.

* **🎨 CSS: Layout & Selectors**
    * **Box Model:** Deep dive into **padding**, **border**, and **margin** to prevent container overflow.
    * **Interaction (UX):** Used **:hover** pseudo-classes for visual feedback.
    * **Relationship Selectors:** **+** (Adjacent sibling) and **~** (General sibling).

### 🧩 Problem Solving (Debug Log)
* **Milestone:** Built my first digital newspaper from scratch.
* **Fixes:** Corrected syntax errors in **text-transform** and learned to distinguish **font-weight** from **font-family**.
* **Status:** My **Flexbox** structure is finally starting to make sense.

## 🗓️ [Day 22: February 22nd, 2026]

### 🔨 Forging the Odin Project Sign-up Form
Today I finished the registration form project and, honestly, **the level-up is clear.** I didn't just write code; I made design decisions and used professional tools.

### 🧠 What I learned today:
* **📐 Grid & Real Alignment:** Mastered how to split the screen into columns (**2fr 3fr**) and used **grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr** inside the form so that all inputs stayed perfectly aligned in pairs.
* **🖋️ Typographic Hierarchy:** Reserved the **Norse** font for branding and call-to-action buttons, while using **Inter** for long texts and labels.
* **🌑 Intentional Shadows:** Created a directional **Bottom Shadow** using the Y-axis (**box-shadow: 0 8px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)**). Now the form looks like it’s floating.
* **✨ Micro-interactions:** Configured a professional **:hover** effect that lifts the button using **transform: translateY(-3px)**. It feels **"alive."**

## 🗓️ [Day 23: February 23rd, 2026]

### 🚀 "Today I stopped making a web that 'works' and started making a professional one"
Today was a day of **brutal intensity.** I jumped from visual design to pure logic.

### 📱 The Battle for Adaptability (Responsive Design)
* **The Strategy Shift:** Refactored the main container. From desktop **Grid** to mobile **Flexbox** with **flex-direction: column**.
* **Overcoming CSS Chaos:** Fought against the **CSS Cascade.** Learned to prioritize and organize my selectors so the layout wouldn't **"break"** when shrinking the window.

### 🎨 Refining the Experience (Advanced UI & UX)
* **🔍 Intelligent Validation:** Implemented the **:user-invalid** pseudo-class. Fixed the error where red borders appeared as soon as the page loaded. Now, feedback only appears after interaction. A **"pro"** touch.
* **⚡ Micro-interactions:** Added **transition** and **transform** effects to **input:focus**. The fields **"react"** when you’re about to type.
* **✍️ Elite Typography:** Configured **'Norse'** and **'Inter'** fonts by adjusting **letter-spacing**.

### 🥊 JavaScript and the Booking Logic (The Big Challenge)
> **"From Frustration to Success: How I built the Campus & Crema Engine"**

1. **The "Clean Slate" Moment:** Started the day with code that was a jungle. I made the hard but smart decision: **starting from scratch.** Tearing down the building to build solid foundations.
2. **The Syntax Labyrinth:**
    * **The Symbol War:** Struggled with **=** vs **===**. Discovered that using **(isOccupied === true)** inside a loop is like asking a question to the air. The solution was a direct command: **isOccupied = true;**.
    * **The Chaos of Parentheses and Braces:** Brackets that opened but never closed.
    * **The Treacherous Semicolon:** Found a semicolon right after a **for** loop that was blocking the entire engine.


## 🗓️ [Day 24: February 24th, 2026]

### 🏋️ "Training Session: Algorithms and Data Structures"

### 🚀 Daily Achievements
* **💼 Use Case Resolution:** Practical exercises simulating real environments (**E-commerce**, **Login Systems**, and **User Profiles**).
* **⚙️ Dynamic Logic Construction:** Learned to generate dynamic HTML structures using functions and **Template Literals.**
* **📂 Information Architecture:** Practiced data nesting, integrating **Arrays within Objects**.

### 🥊 The "Fight" with the Code (Error-based Learning)
* **⚔️ The Symbol War:** Consolidated that **{}** are for objects and **[]** are for lists.
* **↪️ The "Return" Challenge:** Identified why functions died when confusing **return** with **console.log.**
* **🧪 Mutation vs Assignment:** Learned the hard way how using **=** instead of **.push()** can destroy a string-based database.

# 🗓️ [Day 25: February 25th, 2026]

### 🏋️ "Training Session: Advanced DOM State & CSS Motion"

---

### 🚀 [Daily Achievements](#)
* **`🔵 Circular State Engine`**: Successfully built a logic loop that increments from level 1 to 10 and executes a hard reset to `0` upon reaching level 11.

* **`🔵 Legendary Mode`**: Developed a visual trigger that transforms the UI (scale, gold borders, and glow) when the user hits the maximum level milestone.
---
### 🥊 [The "Fight" with the Code (The Real Debugging)](#)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Session Summary:** Today was a high-intensity combat between JS Logic and CSS Rendering.
*
* **↪️ The Premature Cleanup (Else Conflict):**
    * **The Fail:** When the level reset to 0, my `else` statement was stripping the "Legendary" styles instantly. The user couldn't even see the achievement before it vanished.
    * **The Fix:** I restructured the conditional logic to ensure the UI state lifecycle allows for visual feedback before the reset phase takes over.
* **🧪 The Syntax Nightmare (Parenthesis & dots):**
    * **The Fail:** The script crashed due to a stray parenthesis in `else{(this.classList...` and a common beginner error: adding dots inside `classList.add('.class')`.
    * **The Fix:** Hard-learned lesson: `classList` methods are already looking for classes, so the dot `.` is redundant and breaks the selector.

### 🏋️ "Training Session on afternoon: JS Error Handling & Diagnostics (Meta - Coursera)"

### 🚀 Daily Achievements
* **`🔴 Specialized Training`**: Advanced through the **Meta - Coursera** curriculum, focusing on code resilience via error management.
* **`🔴 Error Classification`**: Mastered the identification of the "4 Horsemen" of JS errors: **Reference**, **Type**, **Range**, and **Syntax**.
* **`🔴 Fault Tolerance`**: Implemented `try...catch` blocks to build professional applications that don't crash due to unexpected failures.
* **`🔴 Error Object Anatomy`**: Leveraged `.name` and `.message` properties to extract critical data during debugging.

### 🥊 The "Fight" with the Code (Error Logs)

* **⚔️ The ReferenceError:**
    * **The Fail:** Attempting to call an undeclared variable.
    * **The Lesson:** Without `let` or `const`, JavaScript cannot find the "character" in memory.
* **⚔️ The TypeError:**
    * **The Fail:** Using incompatible methods (e.g., `.toUpperCase()` on a number).
    * **The Lesson:** Each data type has its own tools; you can't whisk an egg with a screwdriver.
* **⚔️ The RangeError:**
    * **The Fail:** Passing numerical values that exceed legal limits (e.g., `new Array(-1)`).
    * **The Lesson:** Forcing logical boundaries halts the execution engine.
* **⚔️ The SyntaxError:**
    * **The Fail:** Missing a brace `}` or a parenthesis `)`.
    * **The Lesson:** A "grammar" error that prevents the code from even starting.

### 🧠 Engineering Reflection: The Logical Error

Thanks to the **Meta** materials, I’ve internalized that logical errors are the most critical because the console won't warn you. Constant review and critical thinking are our best defenses.

## 📅 Date: February 26th, 2026
## 🎯 Status: Growth & Deep Understanding

---

### 📖 The Context: The Coursera Exam
Today I completed the official **Coursera** exam on JavaScript functions. Although the system gave me a passing grade, it wasn't enough for me. The exam focused heavily on theory: using `%c` for console styling, local variable scope, and basic function chaining.

Despite having the certificate, I felt the **"syntax nightmare"** was still there. I didn't fully grasp how data traveled from one function to another or why certain symbols were used. The exam felt like a memory test; I wanted a logic test.

---

### 🚀 The Decision: Going Beyond Theory
Dissatisfied with just "passing the test," I decided to bring the code down to earth. I set aside the theoretical exercises and set out to build a **Real-World Case: A Supermarket Ticket Generator**.

My goal was to understand three things the exam didn't quite clarify:
1. **The Data Source:** Where do variables come from if they aren't defined at the top? (Understood: Parameters act as "reserved seats").
2. **Communication:** How does one function pass its result to the next? (Understood: The flow from `return` to argument).
3. **Invocation:** Why can't I use the `+` sign to call a function? (Understood: Parentheses `()` are the only real "power switch").

---

### 🛠️ Technical Achievement: Modular Architecture
I designed a three-tier system that I now understand perfectly:
* **Processor:** `formatearPrecio` (Transforms numbers into currency).
* **Interface:** `imprimirTicket` (Displays the message to the human user).
* **Controller:** `realizarCompra` (The "Boss" function that coordinates the flow between the other two).

---

### 🥊 Debugging Battle (What I actually learned)
* **Conceptual Error:** Trying to "add" functions using `+`. Fixed by understanding that functions must be **invoked**.
* **Syntax Error:** Mixing `${}` with parentheses. I learned that Template Literals are surgical: if you don't close the braces correctly, the code dies.
* **The "Click" Moment:** Understanding that `product` and `price` are temporary names I choose so the code makes sense to other humans.

---

### 📸 Final Code Structure
```javascript
function formatearPrecio(cantidad) {
    return `€${cantidad}`;
}

function imprimirTicket(producto, precioConSimbolo) {
    console.log(`Has purchased: ${producto} for a total of ${precioConSimbolo}`);
}

function realizarCompra(nombreArticulo, valorNumerico) {
    let resultado = formatearPrecio(valorNumerico);
    imprimirTicket(nombreArticulo, resultado);
}

// The call that starts it all:
realizarCompra("Apples", 5);
```

## 💎 Project: Mangata & Gallo - Form Implementation

**Focus:** Building and connecting the customer inquiry form for the jewelry catalog.

* **JavaScript Integration:** Linked the form to a `script.js` file using the `<script>` tag at the end of the body to handle submission logic.
* **Asset Management:** Applied CSS to the form background to ensure the brand's aesthetic remains consistent without distorting the background imagery.

### ⚠️ Technical Debt (Current Status)
* **Functional Logic:** The script is successfully linked, but the data collection logic is still being refined.
* **The "Fight":** Currently debugging a logical error where the form data isn't being captured correctly on the "submit" event. I plan to apply the "Master Function" structure learned today to better organize this process.
* **Goal:** Achieve a fully functional validation system for the contact section.

## 🎯 Status: Dark Mode button implemented

### 🌓 The Achievement: Native Dark Mode
Today I finalized the implementation of a functional **Dark Mode** for my web portfolio. After several working sessions, I’ve successfully made the interface adapt to user preferences, improving accessibility and eye comfort.

#### 🛠️ How I did it
1. **JavaScript Logic**: I used DOM manipulation to create an *Event Listener* that detects clicks on the theme toggle button, triggering a `classList.toggle('dark-mode')` on the document body.
2. **CSS Architecture (Design Tokens)**: Instead of changing colors individually, I designed a system using **CSS Variables (`Custom Properties`)**. This makes the theme switch centralized, scalable, and extremely fast.

#### ⚔️ Challenges & Learning
* **Order vs. Chaos**: I faced a "jungle" of duplicated styles and hardcoded colors that were blocking inheritance. Refactoring the code was essential for the variables to work properly.
* **Strict Syntax**: I discovered that CSS is unforgiving; a single misplaced closing brace `}` could invalidate entire sections of my code. I learned that **hierarchy and order** are not optional, but the foundation of professional development.

#### 🚀 Result
I moved from a cluttered file to a clean architecture that stands out for its efficiency.

#### 🚀 Results

## Session: Deep Dive into OOP and Inheritance (Meta Course)
**Date:** February 27, 2026

### 📝 Progress Summary 

* **S (Situation):** 📍 While progressing through the **Meta** specialization, I encountered Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts that felt highly abstract and challenging to visualize in practice.
* **T (Task):** 🎯 My goal was to understand and apply class hierarchy and inheritance in JavaScript, moving from theory to building a functional `Person` and `Employee` model.
* **A (Action):** 🛠️ I designed and debugged a class structure where I:
    * Implemented `extends` to establish inheritance between classes.
    * Refined the use of `super()`, learning to invoke it as a function to initialize parent properties correctly.
    * Ensured proper data access using `this` and optimized the output formatting with **Template Literals** (backticks).
* **R (Result):** ✅ I successfully translated abstract concepts into solid, functional code. I have consolidated my mastery of inheritance mechanics, enabling me to build more scalable logic for my upcoming web development projects.
